# PokerVision
A Python program that can calculate the odds of winning a poker hand using pytesseract and pypokerengine. 
This was written in Python 3.9.

You first need to pip install pytesseract.
You then need to pip install pypokerengine.

You need to define in the code where the window of the pokergame takes place.

poker.py is the main file so use "py poker.py". A GUI will load up and you need to enter the number of players.
The results will be showed in the terminal saying if you should fold or raise.

Keep in mind that this is work in progress...
